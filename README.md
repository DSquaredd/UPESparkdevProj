# UPESparkdevProj
Code to control autonomous mobile robot and extinguish short distance single flame fire.  

As a part of the robotics sparkdev team from UPE club we designed and built a fire extinguishing robot. We used arduino to program motor control and used ROS with a LIDAR sensor to detect obsticles.  

Code provided is a draft to motor control, many issues present with sensor information and LIDAR connection.
Lack of time posed an issue to provide a working robot.
