# UPESparkdevProj
Code to control autonomous mobile robot and extinguish short distance single flame fire.  

In Spring 2022 I was part of the UPE Sparkdev Robotics team, we designed and built a fire extinguishing robot. We used arduino to program motor control and used ROS with a LIDAR sensor to detect obsticles.  

I was responsible of making sure the hardware was working corretly and programmming motor control, servo actuation, proximity sensor, and LEDs. 
occasionally had to solder parts. 

Code provided is a draft to motor control, many issues present with sensor information and LIDAR connection.
Lack of time posed an issue to provide a working robot.
